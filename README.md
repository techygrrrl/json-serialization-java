# JSON Serialization example

This example uses Google's [Gson](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.10.1#gradle) for JSON serialization. See the `build.gradle` file for how to include the dependency. There may be an equivalent for LibGDX but I find Gson the easiest to work with. You can likely include Gson as a dependency in your project.

## How it works

### Project structure

The project structure looks like this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ HELP.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ build.gradle
â”œâ”€â”€ gradle

        â”‚Â Â              â”œâ”€â”€ JsonSerializationApplication.java

            â”œâ”€â”€ application.properties
            â”œâ”€â”€ static
            â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ data.json
            â””â”€â”€ templates

12 directories, 14 files
```

### Your data

See the `src/main/resources/static/data.json` file. I added some fields explicitly as null to keep the data structure consistent.


### Dialogue model

There is a class in `src/main/java/models/Dialogue.java` that is the POJO (plain old Java object) representation of your dialogue. It has methods to help make it easy to work with.


### Main application

The application is a Java Spring Boot app (for no reason in particular, just that was an option I knew in the Intellijelly config).

The file `src/main/java/stream/techygrrrl/jsonserialization/JsonSerializationApplication.java` has the main code.

What's happening:

1. JSON is being read from file as raw JSON on lines 18-25. The `JsonArray` class is from Gson, which is different than the one you're using.
2. Line 28 we use Gson and reflection to create a type token for the `Dialogue` class, which is the POJO described above.
3. Line 29, Gson will attempt to deserialize the data from the JsonArray into the type defined `ArrayList<Dialogue>`.
4. If this deserialization is successful, lines 32 and onward should run and you should see output about your dialogues printed to the console.


### JSON utils

The Gson implementation is abstracted into this file, which lives at `src/main/java/stream/techygrrrl/jsonserialization/JsonUtils.java`.


### File utils

Reading the static JSON file from the resources directory has been abstracted into this file at `src/main/java/stream/techygrrrl/jsonserialization/FileUtils.java`.


### Project dependencies

As mentioned above, Gson was added to the project and can be seen on line 21 as `implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1'`.

The dependencies are specified in the Gradle file at `./build.gradle`.


## Console output

When running, you should see the following console output:
